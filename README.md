# IIIF Manifest export plugin

This is a prototype plugin intended to produce IIIF manifests from eprint records.

The use case is to help integrate the Universal Viewer (https://github.com/UniversalViewer/universalviewer) into EPrints to build repositories like http://archive.kingsfund.org.uk/ and http://linnean-online.org/ - therefore current versions of the plugin will contain functionality specific to this use case.
